  My keyboard layout will overwrite several existing key sequences. When this is not satisfactory, use existing key sequence or select keys 
  from those that you will not require. Link2FS Keys may not accept all key combinations.

  > Set the Communications Com Port  to that used by the Arduino IDE to download the sketch. CH340 controlled board channels may change
      by one or two units from the number used in an earlier session. 
	> Change ‘Destination program name’ if not running FSX to which is displayed in the task bar.
	> Change ‘Delay in Milliseconds’ to 00.
  > The Arduino board may be connected to the USB cable while programming. If ‘Connected’ is displayed in red, punch ‘Connect or Disconnect Com Port’ 
  > Punch ‘ENTER PROGRAMMING MODE’
	> To program ‘Eyepoint (move down)	‘ 
	  Enter 00 in the box between ‘D’ and Pin Number
	  Press and release the shift key then press and release the letter B – or your keystrokes
       Punch ‘Save “Key” codes  ---  D000 +b appears in the box ‘D’ Key Codes
	  Double punch a code to erase then repeat with correct key presses
	  Enter the 11 remaining codes
	  Punch ‘EXIT programming’ 
	  Punch 'Save the changes'
	  Punch the yellow box to connect your Arduino board to Flight Simulator through ‘Keys’
